# **Code-to-md**
*inspired by [code_to_md](https://github.com/Dinex-dev/code_to_md) by @Dinex-dev*

## **Code isn't fully made yet! So Don't blame me for the disappearance of moon if you run it!!**

### So What is it?

So you provide a folder with a bunch of code files, e.g., .c files; and this script will generate a single .md file with 
all these files in the following format

    1. <first comment in file> as title 
    The rest as code block

and so on with next file and so on and so on and.... (rip Engish)

### Why?

~~Because I can, Python is easy and posting on Github is free~~

To automate stuff like [this](https://github.com/realKarthikNair/Learning-C-Lang/blob/main/basics/basics.md), for example.

### Why not use just something like [code_to_md](https://github.com/Dinex-dev/code_to_md) instead of making the same thing again from scratch in python?

~~Because I suck at bash and python is love~~

1. Bash isn't really cross-platform (e.g., Windows)
2. The more 'features' you add on a bash script, god it looks so awful for normies like me to understand (I am a linux user but making and maintaining bash scripts isn't really my cup of tea so i can't make his existing project better on my own)

### When will i make it fully? 

~~At the time of writing this, it is Feb 3 2022, 01:24 IST. Maybe by 2023 the same time?~~

Soooooooon (note that 'soon' is relative)
